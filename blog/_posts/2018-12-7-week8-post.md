I feel like  we should be making our own code, opposed to copying someone else's. We should make our blog page from scratch, by ourselves, so we can get a better sense on how to code. This week we made a collage on the flag we were given on Monday. I was given the flag Pakistan, where there's a star, and a cresent in the middle. We had to explain the proportions, and all the colors in the flag. We had to make it perfect, with all of the proportions, and colors. We then had to label everything, and also add the proportions. Im guessing we're going to code and create the flag through Pyret. I'm also guessing we have to make everything perfect, with the correct colors and proportions, and write a little summary on it.
