This week we started to learn how to code shapes on to a site called "pyret." We have chossen a flag, from "www.fotw.info ," and make a collage of the flag. I have decided to choose the Swiss flag, which is where i'm from, and had to make a collage out of contruction paper, glue, and graph paper. After i'm done with that, I have to code the flag correctly, on pyret, with the correct colors.
