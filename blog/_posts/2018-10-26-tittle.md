#WEEK 7
```
This week we started to learn about tables, and how to create them.
```

```
In this image, we looked at the components of what made up a table. We also had to add more rows, and catagorize each shape into what goes where. Later, we started to look at definitions and contracts, and what they did. 
>*Contracts are what they do* 
>*Definitions is the brakdown of the program*
We had to solve a series of problems using contrcts and definitions.
we had to solve the following:

1. Design a function called double, which takes in a number and doubles it.
2. Design a function called triple, which takes in a number and triples it.
3. Design a function called plus1, which takes in a number and adds one to it.
4. Design a function called multiplicative inverse, which takes in a number and produces its multiplicative inverse.
5. Design a function called mystery, that takes in a number and subtracts 4.
6. Design a function called red-spot, which takes in a number and draws a solid red circle, using the number as the radius.
7.  Design a function called double-radius, which takes in a radius and a color. It produces an outlined circle of whatever color was passed in, whose radius is twice as big as the input.
8.  Design a function double-width which takes in a height and a color. The function produces a solid rectangle, which is whatever height and color were passed in. Its width is twice the height.
9. Design a function called golden-rectangle, which takes in a height and a color and produces a solid rectangle, which is whatever height and color were passed in. Its width is in the golden ratio to its height. You will need to conduct an internet search to find the golden ratio.
10. Design a function called hypotenuse, which takes in the length of two legs of a right triangle and produces the length of its hypotenuse.
11. Design a function called distance, which takes in two coordinates as x1, y1, x2, y2 and produces the linear distance between the two points.
12. Design a function called first-char, which takes in a string and returns the first character.
13. Design a function called first-to-last, which consumes a string and returns a string where the first character has been moved to the end.
14.  Design a function called remove-ith, which consumes a string and a number and returns a string with the character at the index of the given number removed.
15.  Design a function called pig-latin, which takes the first consonant  of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an ay, or if a word begins with a vowel you just add way to the end. For example, pig becomes igpay, banana becomes ananabay, and ardvark becomes ardvarkway.
