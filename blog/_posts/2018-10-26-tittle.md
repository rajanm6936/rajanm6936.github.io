#WEEK 7
```
This week we started to learn about tables, and how to create them.
```

```
In this image, we looked at the components of what made up a table. We also had to add more rows, and catagorize each shape into what goes where. Later, we started to look at definitions, functions, and contracts, and what they did. Contracts are what they do, Definitions is the brakdown of the program.
