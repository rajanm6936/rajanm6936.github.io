For my flag project, I had to create a flag with the right proportions. For the accurate proportions, I went on to Wikipedia, where it went into through details on the Pakistan flag, my chosen flag. The proportion of the flag length to height is 3 to 2. It also told me the proportions and locations of the star and the two circles. When coding my flag, I had coded the correct proportions of the flag. First I coded the flag length of 3 to 2, and the size to 100. To get the correct length, I multiplied the size by the height, and then the length to get the correct size of the flag. Then I had to code each shape by their color and length. I use x * height, which was any number, times the height that I set. which would correctly place the shape, to map onto the original flag. The Pakistan flag is made up of 5 shapes, two circles, one star, and two Rectangles, and is made up of two colors, white and dark green. The white triangle, which is on the left side is white, which takes up 1/4 of the flag, and the dark-green rectangle takes up 3/4 of the flag. The white circle is placed near the center, while the dark-green circle covers most of the white circle, creating an illusion, of a crescent. And the white star is rotated counterclockwise, which forms the Pakistan flag.
