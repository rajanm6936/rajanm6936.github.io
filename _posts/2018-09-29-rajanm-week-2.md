  This week we started to do more animations, and coding. We had to animate a red ball falling from top to bottom. We started to make a flip book animation, where we drew what we were going to code. When codoing, I had an issue with my spacong errors, where I had a space frm and parathesis and an equal signs, making it unable to run. In the end I did managae to fix my error, and make the ball drop from the top to the bottom. We also had to explain what was moving and why, which was thr red ball because it was the only think that was animated and coded.
