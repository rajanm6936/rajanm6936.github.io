"I kind of like the class, although, we dont learn that much. All we are doing is copying and pasting work, witought learning anything. I would love to continue this, so i have a hobby to do. I could also start to make game designs, or devoloping games. It would also be nice to learn different programing languages, so i could expand the things i can do and learn."
